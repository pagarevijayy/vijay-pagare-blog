# Vijay Pagare

This is the source code for my personal website/blog built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and the [Hugo Bear Blog theme](https://github.com/janraasch/hugo-bearblog). Hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://github.com/pagarevijayy/vijay-pagare-blog).

## ðŸš€ Features

- Super lightweight & fast static site
- Minimalist design inspired by Bear Blog
- SEO-friendly and responsive
- Easy to maintain & deploy

## ðŸ›  Local Development

1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pagarevijayy/vijay-pagare-blog.git
   cd vijay-pagare-blog
   ```

2. **Install Hugo**  
   Follow [Hugo installation instructions](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/).

3. **Start the development server**  
   ```bash
   hugo server -D
   ```
   Your site will be available at [http://localhost:1313](http://localhost:1313).

## ðŸ“¦ Deployment

Run the following to generate a production build:

```bash
hugo --gc --cleanDestinationDir --minify
```

The output will be in the `public/` folder. You can deploy this to GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, or any static hosting provider.

**Vercel Deployment**

```
# Important

For the Vercel build to succeed, you must set an environment variable
named HUGO_VERSION in your Vercel project settings.  

This value should exactly match the Hugo version you use locally.

Example:
HUGO_VERSION = 0.148.2
```
