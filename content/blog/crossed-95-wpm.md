So i recently crossed [95 wpm typing speed](tab:https://x.com/pagarevijayy/status/1953101515276914711). 

### Here are my 3 key take aways:

Backstory, i had hit a typing ceiling around [80 wpm](tab:https://www.linkedin.com/posts/pagarevijayy_typing-selfmastery-activity-7066450138520518656-22D2) max speed, with ~60ish wpm average, and wasn't able to progress for multiple months (years).

To overcome it, i had to remove certain mental blocks

### 1. Always, use the appropriate finger for the specific key

I do [touch typing](tab:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touch_typing). Earlier I used to suck at typing, and I literally learnt  how to type correctly at [~26yo age](tab:https://x.com/pagarevijayy/status/1609568896436293632) from [typing.com](tab:https://www.typing.com/student/lessons). I could never go pass beyond 35-40 wpm because the way i was typing was flawed (it was mostly two fingers and occasionally a few others). Learning to use appropriate fingers for specific keys is must if you wanna go beyond 45 i think. And it's never too late to invest in this skill. Comm'on we're digital natives.

### 2. Target 100% accuracy

This was one of the bits i was missing. It was never the speed that was stopping me, it was the error i encountered while i tried to type fast. The error just blows away the rhythm. I learned about this from a YT video (i'll share it with you, just ping, rn i'm not able to find it.)

Btw, i use [monkeytype](tab:https://monkeytype.com/) for practice, and test difficulty "master" helps with this. The test will restart if you make an error in this mode. Yep, just grind.

### 3. Don't focus on letters, focus on words.

Maybe, another mistake i was making was i was too focused on letters while typing, and this prevented me from going beyond 80 wpm. To go beyond you need to focus on a single word as a unit rather than just a letter. I think this is partially because the screen renders the letters slower than you actually type. There's a lag. 

Bonus

### 4. Focus on Next Word

Maybe to go beyond 100 wpm, the trick is to focus on the next word while you're typing the current one? i don't know. i'll try it out and update! That's the topic for another day.

Bonus Bonus

### 5. Focus on Next Two Words

To go beyond 150 wpm? idk but that's my aim. I'll inform you guys when i achieve it.

Btw, thanks for coming here and reading this. This is my first post on bearblog.dev, i absolutely loved the simplistic idea of this website (in the era of AI slop :p)! It's minimal, neat, and focused. I was looking for one such theme/template for a while now.

You can reach out to me on x/twitter [@pagarevijayy](tab:https://x.com/pagarevijayy) - where i'm experimenting with a psuedo name - Minato Namikaze ⚡️.

Yours truly,
Vijay - signing off!
