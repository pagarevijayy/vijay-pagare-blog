So‚Ä¶ I finally built something I actually wanted ‚Äî a Weekly Work Tracker for personal use.

I've been toying with this idea of building software for personal use for quite sometime now, but couldn't gather enough motivation to actually go and execute. Until yesterday. That's when i tried claude.ai‚Äîand, oh bwoy, it's freaking amazinggg!!

I vibe coded an entire app in almost a single prompt. 

So actually my motivation was to generate a notion template to track my weekly todos (i have recently developed a habit of keeping a paper on my desk and noting a few tasks for the day and knocking them off ‚Äîneeded something similar digitally). But notion AI did a really poor job of realising my dream, so with lots of hope, i then went to chatgpt4, and asked it to materialize my vision. It was disappointing too, I wasn't impressed by the results. 

Then I wondered why would i want chatgpt to generate a notion template for me when i can directly ask an LLM model with the same prompt to generate a mini web app for me? And i wanted to explore claude, cursor and gemini-cli for a while now, so i gave a shot to claude and was pleasantly surprised! It precisely created what i wanted with custom logic and added a few beautiful aspects to it on its own which i never asked. I totally loved it! The experience was simply [delta 4 ‚Äî as per kunal shah theory](tab:https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=avR_8NlOgsc&t=30).

The AI genie is out of the bottle. It's only a matter of time it will become as native to us as stuff from industrial & PC revolution. Like electricity, bulbs, motors, machines, laptops, mobile, and the internet.

The era of personal software is here ‚Äî and it's fully AI driven. AI Native?

I feel, [now is the time](tab:https://x.com/pagarevijayy/status/1950118631850791224), to go all in on AI. As per [roger's curve](tab:https://b-plannow.com/en/the-rogers-curve-a-guide-to-the-diffusion-of-innovation-in-the-marketplace/), we're no longer early adopters, rather, an early majority. So, for now embrace the AI curve and keep building stuff. Like I did ‚Äî [btw demo here](https://weekly-work-tracker.vercel.app/). 

You can find more about the technical documentation for this project - [here on github](tab:https://github.com/pagarevijayy/weekly-work-tracker/blob/main/readme.md). 

It's open source. Because why not! ü§∑üèª
