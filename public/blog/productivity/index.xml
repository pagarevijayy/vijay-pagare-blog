      <description>&lt;p&gt;So… I finally built something I actually wanted — a Weekly Work Tracker for personal use.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;img src=&#34;https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/95407c6c-14c6-40e7-8986-87029d333a6b&#34; /&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been toying with this idea of building software for personal use for quite sometime now, but couldn&amp;rsquo;t gather enough motivation to actually go and execute. Until yesterday. That&amp;rsquo;s when i tried claude.ai—and, oh bwoy, it&amp;rsquo;s freaking amazinggg!!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I vibe coded an entire app in almost a single prompt.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So actually my motivation was to generate a notion template to track my weekly todos (i have recently developed a habit of keeping a paper on my desk and noting a few tasks for the day and knocking them off —needed something similar digitally). But notion AI did a really poor job of realising my dream, so with lots of hope, i then went to chatgpt4, and asked it to materialize my vision. It was disappointing too, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t impressed by the results.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
